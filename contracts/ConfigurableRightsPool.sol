/**
 * @author Balancer Labs
 * @title Smart Pool with customizable features
 * @notice PCToken is the "Balancer Smart Pool" token (transferred upon finalization)
 * @dev Rights are defined as follows (index values into the array)
 *      0: canPauseSwapping - can setPublicSwap back to false after turning it on
 *                            by default, it is off on initialization and can only be turned on
 *      1: canChangeSwapFee - can setSwapFee after initialization (by default, it is fixed at create time)
 *      2: canChangeWeights - can bind new token weights (allowed by default in base pool)
 *      3: canAddRemoveTokens - can bind/unbind tokens (allowed by default in base pool)
 *      4: canWhitelistLPs - can restrict LPs to a whitelist
 *      5: canChangeCap - can change the BSP cap (max # of pool tokens)
 *
 * Note that functions called on bPool and bFactory may look like internal calls,
 *   but since they are contracts accessed through an interface, they are really external.
 * To make this explicit, we could write "IBPool(address(bPool)).function()" everywhere,
 *   instead of "bPool.function()".
